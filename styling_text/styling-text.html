	<p>
		<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonoidea>Ammonites</a> are an extinct group of marine animals in class Cephalopoda. These molluscs are closer related to living coleoids.</p>

	<h3 id="sec2">the Name</h3>
	<p>Ammonite fossil shells usually take the look of a spiral shape, although there are some that do not. This spiral shape is where they got their name, Pliny the Elder near Pompeii during 79 AD called these fossils ammonis cornua. This was derived from an Egyptian god with spiral horns named Amun.</p>

	<h3 id="sec3" >How They Lived</h3>	
	<p>The ammonite species was known to appear around 400 million years ago and are thought to have become extinct around the time of the Dinosaurs. Because they are extinct along with their closets relatives, not much is known about how they lived. However, it is believed that they were deep ocean dwellers because their fossils are often found in rocks that are in conditions where there is little to no bottom dwelling life. It is believed that they fed on plankton and avoided predation by squirting ink. Traces of the ink can still be found in fossils.</p>
