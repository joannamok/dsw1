	<h1>the Ammonite</h1>
	<h2>What is a Ammonite?</h2>
	<p>Ammonites are an extinct group of marine animals in class Cephalopoda. These molluscs are closer related to living coleoids.</p>
	<h3>A few examples of coleoids are:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>octopuses</li>
		<li>squid</li>
		<li>cuttlefish</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Ammonite fossil shells usually take the look of a spiral shape, although there are some that do not. This spiral shape is where they got their name, Pliny the Elder near Pompeii during 79 AD called these fossils ammonis cornua. This was derived from an Egyptian god with spiral horns named Amun.</p>
